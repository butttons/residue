    "description": "Worker tests shared a single D1 instance and migrations_dir in wrangler.jsonc caused double-application of migrations. Fixed by: (1) creating wrangler.test.jsonc without migrations_dir, (2) using readD1Migrations + applyD1Migrations in a setup file per the official cloudflare example pattern, (3) removing all manual beforeAll(applyMigrations) and beforeEach(DELETE FROM) from test files since isolated storage handles cleanup automatically, (4) removing a stale bootstrap test that tested non-existent functionality.",
